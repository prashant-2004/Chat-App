# Chat-App

I had created the Chatting Desktop Application using Java Swing and Socket-Programming in my Diploma career. 

In this project, I use the Java Swing to develop the Desktop Application Front-End View, where I had added JPanel, JFrame,JTextField,JButton,JTextArea,JScrollbar components.
I also created two different views or frames one is for client and other is for Server where, they are being connected to each other by using socket programming in Java.

I had applied my all knowledge that have at that time to make it happen...
